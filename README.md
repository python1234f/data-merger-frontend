# Data Comparison App

The Data Comparison App is a React-based tool designed to allow users to fetch data from two distinct endpoints, compare selected columns from each data set, and highlight matching and non-matching values. Upon making the desired comparisons, users have the capability to merge the data, after which they can receive a downloadable CSV file generated from the backend.

## Features

- Fetch data from two selectable endpoints.
- Display data in a table format for easier visualization.
- Select columns from each dataset to run a comparison.
- Highlight cells with matching and non-matching values.
- Merge the two datasets and receive a CSV file from the backend.
